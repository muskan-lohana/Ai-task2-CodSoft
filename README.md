## Introduction

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can play against the AI opponent, which makes random moves. The game provides an interactive and entertaining way to enjoy a timeless game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script in your preferred development environment.
2. The game will display the Tic-Tac-Toe board, and you will start as 'X' (the player).
3. Enter your moves by specifying the row and column for your 'X'. For example, you can type "0 0" to place your 'X' in the top-left corner.
4. The AI (opponent) will make its moves with 'O' randomly.
5. The game continues until there's a winner or a draw. The result is displayed at the end of the game.

## Game Rules

- The goal is to get three of your marks ('X' or 'O') in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a draw.
- The player ('X') and the AI ('O') take turns to make their moves.
- The AI opponent makes random moves, so it's not an optimal player.

## Technical Details

The game is implemented in Python and uses a simple random move strategy for the AI. The board is displayed in the console, and player input is taken via the command line.
